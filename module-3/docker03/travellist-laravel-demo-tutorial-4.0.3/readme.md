# Travellist - Laravel Demo App

This is a Laravel demo application created for our Laravel at Scale series. 

The branch `tutorial-02` covers containerizing the application to run it with Docker containers.

Once you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can get this environment up and running with:

```
docker-compose build app
docker-compose up -d
```
